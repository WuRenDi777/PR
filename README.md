This programme requires python 3.7 and above.
Because of the large amount of data, you only need to add the test data to the root directory when testing.
Note: this time the choice of the first five data together as a training and testing set of
filenames = ['S1_E1_A1.mat', 'S2_E1_A1.mat', 'S3_E1_A1.mat', 'S4_E1_A1.mat', 'S5_E1_A1.mat']
It needs to be run with the data files and the program files in a root directory.
